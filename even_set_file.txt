Here’s how to create a **music recommendation system in Neo4j** and write the Cypher queries to answer the specified questions.

---

### **Step 1: Model the System**

#### 1. **Create User Nodes**
```cypher
CREATE (ishaan:User {name: "Ishaan", age: 28, city: "Chennai"})
CREATE (priya:User {name: "Priya", age: 32, city: "Pune"})
CREATE (aryan:User {name: "Aryan", age: 25, city: "Jaipur"})
CREATE (meera:User {name: "Meera", age: 38, city: "Lucknow"})
CREATE (kavita:User {name: "Kavita", age: 22, city: "Ahmedabad"});
```

#### 2. **Create Song Nodes**
```cypher
CREATE (kesariya:Song {title: "Kesariya", artist: "Arijit Singh", release_year: 2022})
CREATE (jhoomeJoPathaan:Song {title: "Jhoome Jo Pathaan", artist: "Arijit Singh", release_year: 2023})
CREATE (teraBanJaunga:Song {title: "Tera Ban Jaunga", artist: "Akhil Sachdeva", release_year: 2019})
CREATE (zindaBanda:Song {title: "Zinda Banda", artist: "Anirudh Ravichander", release_year: 2023});
```

#### 3. **Create Genre Nodes**
```cypher
CREATE (bollywood:Genre {name: "Bollywood"})
CREATE (romantic:Genre {name: "Romantic"});
```

#### 4. **Create Relationships**

**LISTENED: Connect Users to Songs with Ratings**
```cypher
CREATE (ishaan)-[:LISTENED {rating: 5}]->(kesariya)
CREATE (priya)-[:LISTENED {rating: 4}]->(jhoomeJoPathaan)
CREATE (aryan)-[:LISTENED {rating: 5}]->(teraBanJaunga)
CREATE (meera)-[:LISTENED {rating: 4}]->(zindaBanda)
CREATE (kavita)-[:LISTENED {rating: 4}]->(kesariya);
```

**BELONGS_TO: Connect Songs to Genres**
```cypher
CREATE (kesariya)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(romantic)
CREATE (teraBanJaunga)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(romantic)
CREATE (jhoomeJoPathaan)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(bollywood)
CREATE (zindaBanda)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(bollywood);
```

**FOLLOWS: Connect Users**
```cypher
CREATE (ishaan)-[:FOLLOWS]->(priya)
CREATE (aryan)-[:FOLLOWS]->(kavita)
CREATE (meera)-[:FOLLOWS]->(ishaan);
```

---

### **Step 2: Write Cypher Queries**

#### **Query 1: Find the Top-Rated Song by Ishaan**
```cypher
MATCH (ishaan:User {name: "Ishaan"})-[:LISTENED]->(song:Song)
RETURN song.title AS Song, song.artist AS Artist, song.release_year AS Year
ORDER BY song.rating DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

#### **Query 2: List All Users Who Have Listened to Songs in the "Romantic" Genre, Along with Their Ratings**
```cypher
MATCH (user:User)-[listened:LISTENED]->(song:Song)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Genre {name: "Romantic"})
RETURN user.name AS User, song.title AS Song, listened.rating AS Rating;
```

---

#### **Query 3: Who Are the Followers of Priya, and What Songs Have They Listened To?**
```cypher
MATCH (follower:User)-[:FOLLOWS]->(priya:User {name: "Priya"})
MATCH (follower)-[:LISTENED]->(song:Song)
RETURN follower.name AS Follower, song.title AS Song, song.artist AS Artist, song.release_year AS Year;
```

---

### **Expected Outputs**

#### **Output for Query 1**
| **Song**    | **Artist**     | **Year** |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Kesariya    | Arijit Singh   | 2022     |

---

#### **Output for Query 2**
| **User**    | **Song**          | **Rating** |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Ishaan      | Kesariya          | 5          |
| Aryan       | Tera Ban Jaunga   | 5          |
| Kavita      | Kesariya          | 4          |

---

#### **Output for Query 3**
| **Follower** | **Song**             | **Artist**           | **Year** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Ishaan       | Kesariya             | Arijit Singh         | 2022     |

---

### **Visualization Suggestions (Optional)**

To enhance the results, you can visualize the relationships using Neo4j’s **Graph Data Science tool**:
- Show `LISTENED` relationships between users and songs.
- Highlight `FOLLOWS` connections between users to see influencer-user dynamics.
- Group songs by genres and analyze user preferences.

This implementation models a basic music recommendation system and allows exploration of user-song relationships effectively! Let me know if you need advanced queries or additional features.

To create a Power BI dashboard for the retail company, follow these steps for each dashboard portion and ensure you properly load, clean, and visualize the dataset.

---

### **Step 1: Download and Load Dataset**
1. **Download the Dataset**: Use the provided link.
2. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Select **"Get Data"** → **"Excel"** (or appropriate source).
   - Import the dataset into Power BI.

---

### **Step 2: Data Preparation**
1. **Verify Columns**: Ensure the dataset includes the specified columns: 
   - `TransactionID`, `StoreName`, `Region`, `ProductCategory`, `SaleAmount`, `CustomerAge`, `CustomerGender`, `CustomerLoyaltyLevel`, `QuantitySold`, and `SaleDate`.
2. **Clean Data**:
   - Remove duplicates and null values, if any.
   - Format columns appropriately (e.g., `SaleAmount` as Currency, `SaleDate` as Date).
3. **Create Calculated Columns/Measures**:
   - **Total Sales Revenue**:
     ```DAX
     TotalSales = SUM('Table'[SaleAmount])
     ```
   - **Sales by Region and Product Category** (for trends):
     ```DAX
     SalesByCategory = SUM('Table'[SaleAmount])
     ```

---

### **Step 3: Create Visualizations**

#### **1. Total Sales Revenue Across All Stores (Card Visualization)**
- **Graph Type**: Card
- **Steps**:
  1. Select the **Card** visualization.
  2. Drag the `TotalSales` measure into the Fields.
  3. Format the card to show the total revenue in currency format.

---

#### **2. Sales Trends by Region (Stacked Column Chart)**
- **Graph Type**: Stacked Column Chart
- **Steps**:
  1. Select the **Stacked Column Chart** visualization.
  2. Drag `Region` to the **Axis**.
  3. Drag `ProductCategory` to the **Legend**.
  4. Drag `SaleAmount` to the **Values**.
  5. Format the chart to display revenue trends by region and category.

---

#### **3. Customer Distribution by Loyalty Level (Tree Map)**
- **Graph Type**: Tree Map
- **Steps**:
  1. Select the **Tree Map** visualization.
  2. Drag `CustomerLoyaltyLevel` to the **Group** field.
  3. Drag `SaleAmount` to the **Values**.
  4. Format the tree map to clearly show the total sales revenue contribution by loyalty levels.

---

#### **4. Top-Selling Stores (Horizontal Bar Chart)**
- **Graph Type**: Horizontal Bar Chart
- **Steps**:
  1. Select the **Clustered Bar Chart** visualization.
  2. Drag `StoreName` to the **Axis**.
  3. Drag `SaleAmount` to the **Values**.
  4. Sort the bars in descending order of sales revenue.
  5. Limit the number of bars displayed to the top-performing stores (e.g., Top 5 or Top 10).

---

#### **5. Customer Age Analysis (Box-and-Whisker Plot)**
- **Graph Type**: Box-and-Whisker Plot (from a custom visual if not built-in)
- **Steps**:
  1. Install the **Box-and-Whisker Plot** visual from the AppSource Marketplace in Power BI.
  2. Drag `CustomerAge` to the **Values**.
  3. Format the chart to show:
     - Median Age
     - Interquartile Range (IQR)
     - Outliers
  4. Add filters to focus on specific segments (if necessary).

---

### **Step 4: Format the Dashboard**
1. **Add Titles and Descriptions**:
   - Title each visualization (e.g., "Total Sales Revenue", "Top-Selling Stores").
   - Add short descriptions for context.
2. **Apply Consistent Theme**:
   - Use a corporate theme for consistent colors and branding.
3. **Add Filters and Slicers**:
   - Include slicers for `Region`, `ProductCategory`, and `CustomerLoyaltyLevel` for interactivity.

---

### **Expected Outputs**

#### **1. Total Sales Revenue Across All Stores**
A card showing the overall revenue (e.g., ₹10,000,000).

#### **2. Sales Trends by Region**
A stacked column chart showing regions on the X-axis, total sales revenue on the Y-axis, and segmented by product categories.

#### **3. Customer Distribution by Loyalty Level**
A tree map with categories (Bronze, Silver, Gold) sized by total sales revenue.

#### **4. Top-Selling Stores**
A horizontal bar chart with stores listed on the Y-axis and revenue on the X-axis (e.g., Top 5 stores).

#### **5. Customer Age Analysis**
A box-and-whisker plot displaying the age distribution of customers, median age, IQR, and outliers.

---

### **Step 5: Publish the Dashboard**
1. Save the report as a `.pbix` file.
2. Publish to the Power BI Service.
3. Share the dashboard with stakeholders and allow them to interact with the slicers and filters for actionable insights.

This dashboard will help the retail company analyze key metrics, optimize marketing strategies, and improve inventory management effectively. Let me know if you need further assistance!
