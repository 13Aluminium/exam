Test Case 1: Evaluate Default Round Robin Algorithm’s Performance

Description: Measure the response time and cost under standard workload conditions using the default Round Robin load balancer.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Configure Round Robin as the load balancer in Cloud Analyst.
	2.	Set up a simulation with a standard workload (e.g., 1000 users, evenly distributed).
	3.	Record the response time and cost.

Expected Result:
Simulated response time and cost should remain within predefined acceptable thresholds, indicating Round Robin’s efficiency in standard scenarios.

Test Case 2: Integrate CustomLoadBalancer and Monitor its Performance

Description: Replace the default load balancer with CustomLoadBalancer and analyze its performance metrics.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Integrate your CustomLoadBalancer into the Cloud Analyst environment.
	2.	Simulate the same workload as in Test Case 1.
	3.	Compare the metrics (response time and cost) against Round Robin.

Expected Result:
The CustomLoadBalancer demonstrates lower response times and operational costs compared to Round Robin, reflecting its optimized load distribution.

Test Case 3: Run Simulation with High User Demand

Description: Simulate a scenario with high user demand to test load distribution under stress conditions.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Increase the number of users to simulate heavy workloads (e.g., 10,000 users).
	2.	Observe how the CustomLoadBalancer distributes traffic across datacenters.

Expected Result:
The CustomLoadBalancer evenly distributes the load, preventing any datacenter from becoming overloaded, thereby maintaining stable performance.


Test Case 4: Simulate Failure of a Datacenter

Description: Test the system’s fault tolerance by simulating the failure of one datacenter during execution.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Start the simulation with multiple datacenters.
	2.	Simulate a failure by disabling one datacenter during runtime.
	3.	Monitor how the CustomLoadBalancer redirects requests.

Expected Result:

Test Case 5: Test Scalability with Increased Brokers

Description: Evaluate the performance of the CustomLoadBalancer with an increased number of brokers to handle additional traffic.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Increase the number of brokers and users in the simulation.
	2.	Measure the response time and cost under the scaled setup.

Expected Result:
The CustomLoadBalancer adapts efficiently to the increased scale, maintaining response time and cost within acceptable thresholds.

Test Case 6: Compare CustomLoadBalancer to Throttled Load Balancer

Description: Perform a comparative analysis of CustomLoadBalancer and Throttled Load Balancer under the same workload.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	Run simulations using the Throttled Load Balancer and CustomLoadBalancer.
	2.	Measure key metrics: response time, cost, and datacenter utilization.

Expected Result:
The CustomLoadBalancer outperforms the Throttled Load Balancer, showing better metrics for response time and cost in specific scenarios (e.g., high-demand situations).
The CustomLoadBalancer seamlessly redirects requests to other datacenters with minimal downtime, ensuring continuity of service.

Additional Metrics to Evaluate

	1.	Average Response Time: Time taken for a request to be processed and responded to.
	2.	Processing Cost: Total cost incurred during simulation for handling requests.
	3.	Datacenter Utilization: Ensure no datacenter is over or underutilized.
	4.	Scalability: Measure how well the algorithm handles increasing workloads.

By conducting these simulations, you can comprehensively evaluate your CustomLoadBalancer’s performance compared to existing algorithms and document the outcomes for each test case.
